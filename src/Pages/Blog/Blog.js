            </div>
            <p className='q-p'><span className='ans'>Ans:</span> The Prototypal Inheritance is a feature in javascript used to add methods and properties in objects. It is a method by which an object can inherit the properties and methods of another object. Traditionally, in order to get and set the [[Prototype]] of an object, we use Object. getPrototypeOf and Object.</p>

              </div>
            </div>
            <p className='q-p'><span className='ans'>Ans:</span> Unit Testing is a type of software testing where individual units or components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software code performs as expected. Unit Testing is done during the development (coding phase) of an application by the developers. Unit Tests isolate a section of code and verify its correctness. A unit may be an individual function, method, procedure, module, or object.</p><br />
            <p className='q-p'>They enable you to catch bugs early in the development process. Automated unit tests help a great deal with regression testing. They detect code smells in your codebase. For example, if you're having a hard time writing unit tests for a piece of code, it might be a sign that your function is too complex.</p>

            <p className='q-p'><span className='ans'>Ans:</span> This post is a comprehensive guide on which is perhaps the right solution for you: Angular vs React vs Vue.

              Just a couple of years ago, developers were mainly debating whether they should be using Angular vs React for their projects. But over the course of the last couple of years, weâ€™ve seen a growth of interest in a third player called Vue.js.

              If you are a developer starting out on a project and cannot decide on which JavaScript framework to use, this guide should help you make a decision.</p>
